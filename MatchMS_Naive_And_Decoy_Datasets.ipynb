This method is presented as a baseline evaluation of the other, more intricate methods.\n",

    "## Spectrum-based Decoy Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The second method is similar to the naive method, as we create the decoy spectral library through choosing fragment ions that co-appear in the spectra from the target spectral library (Fig. 1c): In this spectrum-based approach, we start with an empty set of fragment ion candidates. First, the precursor fragment ion of the target spectrum is added to the decoy spectrum. For each fragment ion added to the decoy spectrum, we choose all spectra from the target spectral library which contain this fragment ion, within a mass range of 5 p.p.m. From these spectra, we uniformly draw (all fragment ions have the same probability to be drawn) five fragment ions that are added to the fragment ion candidate set; we use all fragment ions in case there are fewer than five. We draw a fragment ion from the fragment ion candidate set and add it to the decoy spectrum, then proceed as described above until we reach the desired number of fragment ions that mimics the corresponding library spectrum. The two-step process of first drawing candidates, then drawing the actual decoy spectrum was introduced to better mimic fragmentation cascades and dependencies between fragments. Furthermore, it prevents that fragment-rich spectra dominate the process. Out of the five added candidate fragment ions, between zero and five end up in the final decoy spectrum. Fragment ions with mass close (5 p.p.m.) to a previously added fragment ion mass, or masses above the precursor fragment ion mass are discarded. If the precursor ion is absent from the MS/MS spectrum, we use the selected ion mass to find matching compound masses. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine if there is a parent peak in target spectrum\n",
    "2. If parent peak = false, move to next spectrum in target spectra list.\n",
    "3. If parent peak = true, add to new decoy spectrum object:\n",
    "   - The parent peak is added to the array of peaks in the new decoy object\n",
    "4. Create a list of all spectra from the target list that contain the same fragment ion (search all peaks for a mass identical to or within a close range of the parent peak - mass range of 5 p.p.m)\n",
    "5. Create an empty list of candidate fragment ions that will be drawn from\n",
    "6. Draw 5 fragment ions from each of the spectra on list created at step 4 and add those to candidate list created at step 5\n",
    "7. Randomly draw a fragment ion from the candidate list:\n",
    "   - If its mass < precursor peak of target spectrum AND is not within 5 p.p.m of any other peak, then the peak is added to the      decoy spectrum's list of peaks.\n",
    "   - If it fails either of the conditions above, it is discarded and another candidate fragment is drawn.\n",
    "8. Repeat step 4- 7 until number peaks in decoy spectrum = number of peaks in target spectrum. \n",
    "9. Add completed decoy to decoy spectral library. \n"
